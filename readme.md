## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [the latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [the latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

The documentation site sources come along the source code (as it is a Maven site), so it is always possible to generate them using the following Maven command:

```
$ mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, as otherwise some of the reports won't be created.

## Usage

The application is coded in Java, using Maven to manage the project.

### Prerequisites

The project has been tested on the following Java versions:
* JDK 7
